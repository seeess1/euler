# fibonacci
This is my solution to Problem 2 on Project Euler.

Origin: This program addresses a problem called “Even Fibonacci numbers” posted on Project Euler (https://projecteuler.net/problem=2).

Overall purpose: The problem states: 

“Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.”

How to use this program: Compile the program and enter “./fibonacci” in the command line. The answer to the problem will appear in the terminal window.
